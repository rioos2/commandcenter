The underlying physical resources are used whenever possible and the virtualization layer runs instructions only as needed to make virtual machines operate as if they were running directly on a physical machine. When CPU resources are overcommitted, the Rio/OS host time-slices the physical processors across all virtual machines so each virtual machine runs as if it has its specified number of virtual processors.'
